# snake_game
Snake game programmed in Java with the Java Applet library

The "Snake" game involves the player controlling the head of a snake with arrow keys in order to collide (or "eat") a block located in a rectangular game area that the snake can move around. The snake's tail follows the exact path taken by the snake's head. When a snake eats a block, the player's score increases by 1, a segment is added to its tail and the block is regenerated at another random location in the game area. The snake dies and the game ends if the snake goes outside the game area or if its head collides with its own tail. The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by eating these blocks without dying.

It is important to note that the window for the Java applet uses a coordinate system representing the number of pixels in the x and y direction from the top left corner of the screen. From the top left corner where the x and y coordinates are both 0, the x coordinates increase from left to right and y coordinates increase from top to bottom.
